# Todo App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my Todo App project built with React. It's a simple yet elegant solution for managing your daily tasks with a clean, modern interface.

## Live Demo
Check out the live version here: [Todo App](https://your-netlify-link.netlify.app)

## What I Built

I created this Todo App as a way to practice and showcase my React skills. It includes all the essential features you'd expect from a todo app:

- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)
- Responsive design that works on all devices

## Tech Stack

- React.js for the frontend
- CSS3 for styling
- Google Fonts (Poppins) for typography

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
